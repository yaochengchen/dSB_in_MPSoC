This folder contain notebooks and bitstream files for dSB algorithm using in AXU5EVB-P, as well as scripts and custom IPs that can be used to generate corresponding Vivado projects. 8 bit matrix J (the first bit is the sign bit, the second bit is the integer bit, and the remaining bits are fractional bits) can be sent to FPGA by user.
